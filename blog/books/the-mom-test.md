## "The Mom Sermon"

After picking this book up last Sunday, I was instantly hooked. It completely revolutionized my outlook on customer conversations and how to perform proper market research, since reading it I made a reference to the book in almost every single meeting or conversation I find myself in.

Now, every time I bring it up, my team rolls their eyes and prepare for what they have started calling "The Mom Sermon" where I preach about some concept from the book.

Being so short, this is a book that you can easily finish in a weekend. If you are interested in Innovation or Product Management, be prepared to fill out a couple of pages of notes and absolutely speed through it. I was able to find the book in my library, but there is also some pretty blatant free pdf's online.

## Customer Conversations

The main concept of "The Mom Test", is how to go about customer research. Although it does not focus on how you should take a problem through the validation process, or how to find a problem to solve, I found that it was actually my favorite resource for both of these complex tasks. With just this way of collecting useful information, and some tips about how to go through the process, you are able to infer a good strategy to properly find and validate a problem and solution.

Rob Fitzpatrick describes a seemingly simple, yet subtly advanced method for extracting the most out of a batch of conversations. This is a skill that really requires an immense amount of finesse and focus. You need to be able to develop your idea very quickly, over a short conversation, making the necessary connections and asking the right questions to dig into the root of a problem. All while keeping the conversation short and very casual.
