This project began as a late-night experiment during my ongoing CS journey at Boston University. Amid the constant crunch of startup life—where I rely heavily on LLMs for efficiency—prompt crafting quickly became the biggest productivity bottleneck. I was frustrated by re-writing the same context in every prompting session, and knew there must be a better way.

## The Spark
After looking around for a tool to solve my issue, I was not satisfied with any of the available options. Then, I had a simple idea: why not treat prompts like building blocks? Inspired by the intuitive drag-and-drop functionality of Scratch, I envisioned a tool that would let me assemble and manage prompts as modular components. This way, instead of rewriting or copying and pasting, I could simply reuse components to streamline my workflow.

## Building the Tool

I built the shell of a Chrome extension that brings this idea to life. Here’s what it offers:
- **Modular Design:** Organize your prompt components like blocks. Easily reuse and rearrange them to suit your needs.
- **Quick Assembly:** Assemble and tweak prompts on the fly, cutting down on repetitive setup work.
- **Local Storage:** Save your work directly in the browser, with an option to export your prompt library as JSON for backup.
- **Shared Library:** My dev team and I share a constantly evolving prompt library, helping us generate better outcomes and maintain consistency across our projects.

## Looking Ahead
I’m genuinely in love with this tool—it’s been a real eye opener for managing my prompt workflow. However, as with any experimental project, there’s always room for improvement. I’m eager to see how the community can help evolve it further. If you’re into experimental projects or curious about a fresh approach to prompt engineering, check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/falktravis/Prompt-Builder) and contribute if you have the time. I wish I had more hours in the day to polish it myself, so any help expanding the tool would be awesome!
