Let me preface this post by saying that I have loved my time at BU. Although life is not what I was expecting, it really is a great school, and I would recommend it to anyone who might be inspired by my description of student life. When I was searching for colleges, I never found a straight forward student perspective to ground my opinion. That's what I hope to get at with this post.\r
\r
## Campus\r
When I came to visit BU and took a tour of the campus, I feel like I never really got a good sense of the actual campus. This is not exactly BU's fault, the campus is so large, that it's impossible to explore all the important spaces in a walking tour.\r
\r
The most important thing about the campus, is that its extremely long. The campus is essentially a massive rectangle around Commonwealth Avenue. Sectioned out as West, Central, Fenway, and East Campus. \r
\r
### West\r
West is where 80% of the student population will live. Aside from Warren, The Towers, and a couple other less common dorms, all dorms and most off campus housing is in West. This makes for some pretty dramatic commutes to most things which happen in the other parts of campus. This commute is a large part of student life, and I will touch on it later.\r
\r
Another notable thing about West, is that this is where all Greek Life happens. More specifically, all the Fraternities have their houses in Allston, which is on the furthest end of West, just off campus. If you plan to participate in Greek Life at all, going to events or rushing, you need to keep this in mind. It can be a serious commute.\r
\r
### Central\r
This is where most of your classes and academic life will happen. Most students who live further away from Central Campus will commute to Central at the start of the day, and stay there until all of their classes have finished. There are many nice places to hangout in Central, everyone I know has their go to spots, you really just need to explore campus as much as possible. I still find awesome new spaces all the time.\r
\r
### Fenway\r
There are a couple dorms and a dining hall in Fenway. I don't think I've ever even been at the Fenway campus although I know students who live there. You don't want to live in Fenway, it is so far from everything and not worth the commute.\r
\r
### East\r
East campus is more of an extension of central than anything. I have known people that live in true east dorms, which can be extremely far from West. But generally, East is represented by Marciano Commons(AKA Marci) which is widely known as the best dining hall on Campus, some smaller dorms, and class buildings.\r
\r
## Commute\r
The commute is one of the things that I was very ignorant to before coming to BU. Because of the shape and size of campus, as well as most students living in West, a common commute to class is around 25 minutes. Like I said before, must students choose to make this only once a day, and there are many places to hangout and work in Central. \r
