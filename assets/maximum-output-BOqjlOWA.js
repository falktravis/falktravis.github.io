That’s right, 3 days. Not to mention to 5 college classes I attended(totaling 5 hours), completing an entire algorithms problem set, and reading the entirety of “The Mom Test”(my new favorite product development book, check out my review [here](/blog/books/the-mom-test)). The secret? A system for speedy development which I have been perfecting for 2 years.\r

>Yes, the website has changed since I first published it. [Here](https://github.com/falktravis/falktravis.github.io/tree/three-day-final) is an unchanged version of the website after 3 days.\r

## My System\r
\r
I had a very unnatural introduction to the world of Computer Science. Learning to code around 10 years old with code.org and a lego robotics kit. Because I was so young and reserved about my interests, because coding certainly was not considered cool to my friends, I did not receive a lot of formal education surrounding the topic until high school. Even then I was not able take any serious classes until my senior year. So, I did a lot of my coding holed up in my room with the lights off. Because of this self paced eduction, I learned to do things very sporadically and messy. A mad scramble to complete my project as quickly as possible, using everything at my disposal to do so, and sacrificing what ever gets in my way. Otherwise known as...\r
\r
## The Sprint\r
\r
There are three main components of *The Sprint*, your development environment, physical habits, and focus. I will talk about each here, and give my takes on why they are so important, and how you can embody these principles yourself.\r
\r
### Development Environment\r
\r
Your development environment is often overlooked. Small improvements in your dev environment can make a large impact on your effectiveness compounded over weeks, months, and years. I personally try as many tools as possible, paying through walls when necessary, to build up the perfect dev environment. It will be different for everyone, so the most important thing here is simply to pay attention to it, and do research on ways to improve your set up periodically. I will share some of my secrets here, but I encourage you to create your own Nirvana.\r
\r
**Github Copilot**: I get this for free as a student and it is the best assistant I have discovered to date. I have tried a bunch, but they are very hard to compare. Ultimately, you just need some auto complete tool. Even if its just for the stupid simple auto complete tasks. You should not be expecting Copilot to do any complex coding or fill out entire functions, although sometimes it surprises me.\r
\r
**"Paid" LLM**: I put paid in quotes because you don't actually have to pay for it, just use a paid version. Although I would never to this, there are ways to use the free trials for Claude and the newest GPT almost indefinitely... ;)\r
\r
**Themes and Icons**: Please pay attention to what your editor looks like. However much you think you don't care, nobody wants to look at black and white text all day. Download themes, fonts, icon packs, whatever floats your boat. Have some fun with it.\r
\r
**Notebook**: Please, carry around a notebook. I would assume that if you found this post, you know why you would need a notebook.\r
\r
**Whiteboard**: This one is not always applicable, but I do whatever I can to have a whiteboard at my disposal. At my childhood home I bought a massive $15 piece of crappy whiteboard from home depot and glued it to my wall. There is something really special about standing up and drawing things out with a crisp Expo.\r
\r
**Computer Peripherals**: A mouse is non-negotiable, carry around a cheap bluetooth one. A second monitor and a nice keyboard is great if you have a stationary desk. I actually went the extra mile and built my own keyboard. Does it actually make me faster? No. Good fun though.\r
\r
### Habits\r
\r
There are certain habits that I find to have a large impact on my coding sessions and long term problems. Mainly, my physical environment, music I listen too, caffeine intake, and eating schedule. These beliefs stem from "Atomic Habits", although most are not mentioned in the book, the general principle and motivation for tracking habits is.\r
\r
**Physical Environment**: I advocate never working in your room, even better never working in your house. I find that I am 50% less focused in my house, no exaggeration. It is worth it to travel 20 minutes to a library, the office, or wherever else you designate. The more you follow this principle, the more you are conditioned to accept it, and the more effective it becomes.\r
\r
**Music**: Plain and simple, you want upbeat music that you can sing along too and makes you want to get up and dance, or just boogie around in your seat. I like a mix of pop, rock, some R&B, and a little bit of upbeat country. Slow music makes your thinking equally slow and lethargic.\r
\r
**Caffeine**: No surprise, caffeine helps. I like to keep a steady stream of caffeine to stay at a high level of energy. It varies depending on my current tolerance so you will need to find what works for you. Obvious? Yes. But don't shy away from some coffee.\r
\r
**Food**: This one is often overlooked. Think back to thanksgiving, or the last time you ate some, massive meal. After you eat a lot, you get really tired. Although its a little less noticeable, even just a decently heavy meal will have some affect on your output. I find it best to eat many, small meals, periodically throughout the day. Strategically placing these little breaks in my workflow when I start to burn out. Eat healthy food as well. My diet consists mostly of rice, lean meat, fruit, and vegetables. Obviously I'm not a saint, I eat a lot of shit, but be mindful.\r
\r
### Focus\r
\r
I won't go to deep into this here, but every time I sit down to code, there are a few different levels of coding session I might achieve. Highest among these is *Deep Work*, taken from the book, which I would highly recommend. The important thing about *Deep Work* is that once you reach it, do everything possible to not break the session until you burn out. This might seem simple, but if you take this principle to the maximum it becomes very extreme. In some cases, I will fight a bursting urge to use the bathroom for 30 minutes, squirming around relentlessly, so as to not leave the desk. Often times simple tasks like this might not break your session, but for me *Deep Work* is classified by this magnetism to the screen. The resolve to not give up on your task until you are physically forced to do so. A similar thing happens with hunger, and sometimes, although I'm not proud of this one, classes.\r
\r
There is another kind of focus that I should mention here. This is not a type of session focus, it is a focus over days or weeks. This type of focus is not really teachable. This type of focus is categorized mainly by what you are thinking about when you are on idle. There are always periods of the day where you are auto-piloting through a task that doesn't require full brain function. If you find yourself thinking about your project every time you go idle, you have achieved this long term focus. As far as I can tell this is not something that can be taught. It comes from an intense interest in the project and a strong drive to succeed as quickly as possible. While this style of focus might not seem incredibly important, I find that my very best ideas come from idle thinking. If you are not able to idle on your project, you need to spend a lot more time on active thinking.\r
\r
With projects that I get really invested in, I will take this level of focus to such an extreme that I actually start dreaming about code and problem solving. There is no way to actually make any meaningful contributions to the project while sleeping, but it is a sign of this deep, long term focus. \r
\r
>This phenomena is nearly impossible to explain, I would say that it feels like exerting maximum brain function, trying to solve an impossible arbitrary puzzle.\r
\r
## Three Regular Days\r
\r
My key to an extreme level of productivity is not to spend a lot of time working, its to spend a very little time on things that are not productive. As I'm sure you can tell from reading this post, I spend a lot of effort to increase my efficiency even marginally. When I decided to build this website, I did not really have a focus on speed. All I needed to do was switch it to my main project until finish. Using the system described above, which really encapsulates my regular routine, this is the speed at which I work on projects regularly. Obviously my previous react and web design knowledge helped significantly. If I had to learn a new technology to accomplish this, while still working at the same pace, a lot of time would be spent learning. For this project I only had to touch up on some react knowledge and figure out how to serve markdown files with Vite. Most of my projects require much more digging around.\r
\r
Thanks for reading! I am really proud of this project, I am spending a lot of time condensing my thoughts into posts like this which I can display to anyone with similar interests. Check out some of my other posts or my portfolio! Thanks.`;export{e as default};
