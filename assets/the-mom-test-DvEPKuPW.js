## "The Mom Sermon"\r
\r
After picking this book up last Sunday, I was instantly hooked. I spent 2ish hours reading it that day until I was too tired to continue. For the next two days I read as much as possible, finding every possible moment to tell my friends about what I was learning and practically forcing them to pick it up themselves. It completely revolutionized my outlook on customer conversations and how to validate problems, and since reading it I have made a reference to the book in almost every single meeting or conversation I find myself in.\r
\r
I then applied my new knowledge to a customer meeting which we had set up before I picked up the book, and came out of the meeting with better results then we have ever seen before. Now, every time I bring it up, my friends roll their eyes and prepare for what they have started calling "The Mom Sermon" where I preach about some concept from the book.\r
\r
Being so short, this is a book that you can easily finish in a weekend. If you are interested in Innovation or Product Management, you should be prepared to fill out a couple of pages of notes and absolutely speed through it. I was able to find the book in my library, but there is also some pretty blatant free pdf's online.\r

## Customer Conversations\r
\r
The main concept of "The Mom Test", is how to go about gathering data to validate or further your product. Although it does not focus on how you should take a problem through the validation process, or how to find an problem to solve in the first place, I found that it was actually my favorite resource for both of these complex tasks. With just this way of collecting useful information, and some tips about how to go through the process, I really feel like I got a good grasp on how to properly find and validate a problem and solution.\r

Rob Fitzpatrick focuses on customer conversations as a medium for this information. And describes a seemingly simple, yet subtly advanced method for extracting the most out of a batch of conversations. This is a skill that really requires an immense amount of finesse and focus. You need to be able to develop your idea very quickly, over a short conversation, making the necessary connections and asking the right questions to dig into the root of a problem.`;export{e as default};
