## "The Mom Sermon"

After picking this book up last Sunday, I was instantly hooked. I spent 2ish hours reading it that day until I was too tired to continue. For the next two days I read as much as possible, finding every possible moment to tell my friends about what I was learning and practically forcing them to pick it up themselves. It completely revolutionized my outlook on customer conversations and how to validate problems, and since reading it I have made a reference to the book in almost every single meeting or conversation I find myself in.

I then applied my new knowledge to a customer meeting which we had set up before I picked up the book, and came out of the meeting with better results then we have ever seen before. Now, every time I bring it up, my friends roll their eyes and prepare for what they have started calling "The Mom Sermon" where I preach about some concept from the book.

## How to Start

Being so short, this is a book that you can easily finish in a weekend. If you are interested in Innovation or Product Management, you should be prepared to fill out a couple of pages of notes in your notebook and absolutely speed through it.
