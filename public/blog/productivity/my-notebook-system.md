At this point me and my primary notebook are practically inseparable. It has completely changed the way I think, increased my effectiveness, and gave me a way to deal with mental blocks. I operate two notebooks simultaneously, one for projects, and one for journaling. Writing roughly 3-4 pages every day, split between the two.

## Primary Notebook

Your Primary Notebook is the book you should be carrying at all times. It should never take you more than a minute to start spilling a thought into your book. It happens to me quite often that I will be idling on a simple task, usually cooking, when I have an idea that I need to write down. If I am not able to capture and expand upon the though within a minute of it surfacing, I don't get the maximum value out of it.

Expanding upon your thoughts is a big component of this book. When I write in my primary book, I think of it like a conversation between my conscious and unconscious mind. Only when I am actively writing, do I make my deepest connections. As if its only during this period that my unconscious mind is able to contribute to active thoughts. Creating beautiful trains of thought that spill down pages, along with a permanent record of your previous thoughts that you can go back to later. 

This book also contains notes from books I read, important conversations, and other general learning/notes. It's a one stop thinking depot which you should be religiously devoted too.

## Journal

I keep a larger, more static notebook as my journal. I don't carry this around, although I think that most people should. I keep it in my room and usually only log in it right before I go to bed. Only taking it out before then if I really have a lot on my mind. This is a highly personal artifact and its the only place that you can have a 100% confidential conversation. It really helps deal with stress pressure and just thinking through more personal items that have been weighing on me. I won't give to much direction here because you need to find your own style, but I would highly recommend the practice.

## Choosing the right set

I find that the pen/pencil and notebook I am using greatly affects how effective my writing can be. You might not think it, but having a nice set is a total must. 

### Notebook

Personally, I use Moleskine notebooks. Are the cheap? No. But there is something about a Moleskine that just makes you want to write. This is a somewhat common phenomena, and my friends who also use Moleskines report the same feeling. Although it is more impactful for some than others, I would definitely recommend picking one up to test it as your primary.

There is no shortage of recommendations for alternatives online, and it somewhat depends on what you choose as your writing utensil, so test out some combinations and find one that you rock with.

### Pen

I just bought a Uni Jetstream EDGE 0.38mm, along with some Uni Jetstream 0.7mm and 1.0mm refills. I LOVE the Jetstream EDGE 0.38mm body, but the refill it comes with is scratchy and to thin for my liking. That is why I went for the additional refills, which totally put it together. I have been using it for about a week, and I think I will be using this as my main for a while. Previously I used the PaperMate Inkjoy Gel 1.0mm, that was also super nice, and probably a little smoother than the Jetstream refills, but I didn't love the body it came with, and the grip wasn't stellar.

While you can do your own research on what works best, and it will differ for everyone, I really just want to stress the importance of having a nice set. I promise it will affect your writing, and its worth the time and couple extra dollars to put it together.

## Organization

One of the big benefits of keeping a system of notebooks, is the ability to look into your past brain states. I love doing this periodically. It can be a pretty amazing blast from the past, often giving me inspiration, and really wowing me with my growth over seemingly short periods of time.

The key to this, is keeping your system as organized as possible. Here are some tips:
1. **Separate trains of thought** -> No two categories of thought should occupy the same page
2. **Page Titles, Numbers, and Dates** -> Title every page, and put the page number and date in the header
3. **Index** -> Put a index in the last couple pages of the book, otherwise finding a specific page is impossible
4. **Leave Space for Important Items** -> Leave the first 10 pages of the book open. I put goals, important learning, deadlines, a reading list, my mission statement, and keep my tech stack in here. This should vary heavily person to person but choose the most important things to you to fill this section.

Thanks for reading!
